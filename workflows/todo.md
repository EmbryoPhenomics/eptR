## Analysis fixes required:

* Test and possibly fix model creation for trainSVM()
* Make sure accuracy calculations and post-processing of predictions are correct for testSVM()
* Write methods for parallel cross validation and model creation
* Implement parallel methods for feature growth and subsequent model training and testing
* Implement method tree for prepping data, training models, testing and returning best model results

## Wrangling fixes required:

* Implement methods for aggregating multiple types of raw or mean data, for downstream analysis

## Visualisation fixes required:

* Implement methods for graphing predictions obtained either from training or testing classifiers
