# eptR

This repository includes the R code associated with the analysis and visualisation of datasets containing energy proxy traits (EPT). Whilst the majority of functions are written for EPT data, there are some additional methods that can be applied to other datasets produced by EmbryoCV.

## Documentation and additional info

Documentation for the main scripts above can be found in their respective markdown files. Source code can be found archived in the source folder and any visualisations produced can be found in the visualisations folder. Methods that are not ready for generic applications can be found in trialMethods - use these methods at your own risk. Lastly, all workflow scripts can be found in the folder of the same name - if nothing else, these serve as example use cases for most of the methods described in the main scripts.
